# Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. 
# It occurs when high blood sugar levels over an extended period of time damage the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye
# Causes of diabetic retinopathy
Blurred or fluctuating vision
Dark or empty areas in the field of vision
Floaters (spots or dark strings) in the visual field
Difficulty seeing colors or contrasting shades
Impaired night vision
Early detection, regular eye examinations, and timely treatment are crucial for managing and preserving vision in retinal diseases. 
# So we have developed an GUI that will predict the people having diabetic retinopathy or not having the same.
